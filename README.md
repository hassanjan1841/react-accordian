# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Components

This repository contains two components:

### Accordion

The Accordion component provides a collapsible content section with a title that can be clicked to expand or collapse the content. It is useful for displaying information in a compact and organized manner.

### Random Color Generator

The Random Color Generator component generates random colors and displays them on the screen. It can be used for various purposes such as generating color palettes, testing color combinations, or simply for fun.

Feel free to explore the individual component directories for more details and usage instructions.
